# MPM-World
MPM-World is an open-source fluid engine for the physically-based simulation of fluids. The simulation in this library is based on the material point method (MPM) method.





#### To do list:

* 学习[QuanTaichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/quantaichi)中fluid solver的写法（似乎是集成MPM,Euler的solver)（中优先级）
* [High-Performance MLS-MPM Solver with Cutting and Coupling (CPIC)](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/taichi_mpm)可以研究一下（低优先级）
